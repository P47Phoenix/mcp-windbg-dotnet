# ADR-0001: Establish PRD Documentation Structure

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project requires a lightweight, consistent, and extensible framework to capture product intent, feature scope, architectural decisions, and release readiness for `mcp-windbg-dotnet`.

## Decision
Adopt a `docs/prd` hierarchy containing:
- Root PRD hub (`README.md`)
- Core templates: `_template-prd.md`, `_template-feature-spec.md`, `_template-acceptance-checklist.md`
- Decision log (`decision-log/` with ADR files)
- Backlog (`backlog/` folder)
- Metrics (`metrics/` folder)
- Release plan (`release-plan/` folder)
- Risk register (`risk-register.md`)

Naming conventions:
- ADR files: `ADR-XXXX-title.md` (zero-padded sequential)
- PRDs: `PRD-<short-name>.md`
- Feature specs: `FEATURE-<short-name>.md`

## Rationale
- Encourages separation of high-level product intent (PRD) from detailed implementation (feature spec).
- Standard ADR pattern improves traceability & onboarding.
- Templates reduce drift and ensure coverage (metrics, risks, rollout).

## Consequences
Positive:
- Faster onboarding; clear single hub.
- Decisions recorded early reduce rework.
- Facilitates future automation (e.g., generating indexes).

Negative / Trade-offs:
- Requires discipline to maintain.
- Slight upfront overhead before implementing features.

## Alternatives Considered
1. Single monolithic `PRODUCT.md` file (rejected: scales poorly).
2. Using GitHub Issues only (rejected: loses structured requirements & ADR permanence).

## Follow-Up Actions
- Add backlog and risk register population guidelines (future ADR if process changes).
- Consider automation script for next ADR number.
